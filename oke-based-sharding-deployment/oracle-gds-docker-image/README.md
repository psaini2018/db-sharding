# Oracle Sharding on Docker
Oracle Sharding is a scalability and availability feature for custom-designed OLTP applications that enables distribution and replication of data across a pool of Oracle databases that do not share hardware or software. The pool of databases is presented to the application as a single logical database.

Sample Docker build files to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users. For more information about Oracle Database please see the [Oracle Sharded Database Management Documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/en/database/).

## How to build and run
This project offers sample Dockerfiles for:
  * Oracle Database 19c Client (19.3) for Linux x86-64

To assist in building the images, you can use the [buildDockerImage.sh](dockerfiles/buildDockerImage.sh) script.See section **Create Oracle Global Service Manager Image** for instructions and usage.

**IMPORTANT:** Oracle Global Service Manager container is useful when you want to configure Global Data Service Framework. The Global Data Services framework consists of at least one global service manager, a Global Data Services catalog, and the GDS configuration databases. 

For complete Oracle Sharding Database setup, please go through following steps and execute them as per your environment:

### Create Oracle Global Service Manager Image
**IMPORTANT:** You will have to provide the installation binaries of Oracle Global Service Manager Oracle Database 19c  (19.3) for Linux x86-64 and put them into the `dockerfiles/<version>` folder. You  only need to provide the binaries for the edition you are going to install. The binaries can be downloaded from the [Oracle Technology Network](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html). You also have to make sure to have internet connectivity for yum. Note that you must not uncompress the binaries.

The `buildDockerImage.sh` script is just a utility shell script that performs MD5 checks and is an easy way for beginners to get started. Expert users are welcome to directly call `docker build` with their preferred set of parameters.Before you build the image make sure that you have provided the installation binaries and put them into the right folder. Go into the **dockerfiles** folder and run the **buildDockerImage.sh** script as root or with sudo privileges:

```
./buildDockerImage.sh -v (Software Version)
./buildDockerImage.sh -v 19.3.0
```
For detailed usage of command, please execute following command:
```
./buildDockerImage.sh -h
```
### Create Oracle Database Image
To download and build Oracle 19.3 Database image, please refer [README.MD](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/README.md) of Oracle Single Database available on Oracle GitHub repository.

**Note**: You just need to create the image. You will create the container as per the steps given in this document.

### Create Network Bridge
Before creating container, create the macvlan bridge. If you are using same bridge name with same network subnet then you can use same IPs mentioned in **Create Containers** section.

```
# docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=172.16.1.0/24 --gateway=172.16.1.1 -o parent=eth0 shard_pub1_nw
```

If you are planing to create a test env within a single machine, you can use docker bridge but these IPs will not be reachable on user network.

```
# docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=172.16.1.0/24 shard_pub1_nw
```

**Note:** You can change subnet according to your environment.

### Create Containers.
Before creating the GSM container, you need to build the catalog and shard containers. Execute following steps to create containers:

#### Setup Hostfile
All containers will share a host file for name resolution.  The shared hostfile must be available to all container. Create the shared host file (if it doesn't exist) at `/opt/containers/shard_host_file`:

For example:

```
# mkdir /opt/containers
# touch /opt/containers/shard_host_file
```

Add following host entries in /opt/containers/shard_host_file as Oracle database containers do not have root access to modify the /etc/hosts file. This file must be pre-populated. You can change these entries based on your environment and network setup.

```
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
172.16.1.15     oshard-gsm1.example.com  oshard-gsm1
172.16.1.20     oshard-catalog-0.example.com  oshard-catalog-0
172.16.1.21     oshard1-0.example.com   oshard1-0
172.16.1.22     oshard2-0.example.com   oshard2-0
172.16.1.23     oshard3-0.example.com   oshard3-0
```

#### Copy User Scripts to setup Env
From the cloned Oracle Sharding repository, you need to copy Sharding/dockerfile/<version/setupOshardEnv.sh to some other directory to expose to DB containers. In our example, we created /tmp/oshard and copied the file under that location.

#### Password Setup
Specify the secret volume for resetting database users password during catalog and shard setup. It can be shared volume among all the containers

```
mkdir /opt/.secrets/
openssl rand -hex 64 -out /opt/.secrets/pwd.key
```

Edit the `/opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile` and seed the password for grid/oracle and database. It will be a common password for all the database users. Execute following command:

```
vi /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile
```
**Note**: Enter your secure password in above file and save the file.

After seeding password and savint the `/opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile` file, execute following command:

```
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile -out /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile.enc -pass file:/opt/.secrets/pwd.key
rm -f /opt/.secrets/common_os_pwdfile
```

#### Deploying Catalog Container
The shard catalog is a special-purpose Oracle Database that is a persistent store for SDB configuration data and plays a key role in automated deployment and centralized management of a sharded database. It also hosts the gold schema of the application and the master copies of common reference data (duplicated tables)

```
docker run -d --hostname oshard-catalog-0 \
 --dns-search=example.com \
 --network=shard_pub1_nw \
 --ip=172.16.1.20 \
 -e DOMAIN=example.com \
 -e ORACLE_SID=CATCDB \
 -e ORACLE_PDB=CAT1PDB \
 -e OP_TYPE=catalog \
 -e COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE=common_os_pwdfile.enc \
 -e PWD_KEY=pwd.key \
 -v /docker_volumes/oradata:/opt/oracle/oradata \
 -v /tmp/oshard/scripts:/opt/oracle/scripts/setup \
 -v /opt/containers/shard_host_file:/etc/hosts \
 --volume /opt/.secrets:/run/secrets \
 --privileged=false \
 --name catalog oracle/database:19.3.0-ee
```

**Note**: Change environment variable such as ORACLE_SID, ORACLE_PDB based on your env. Also, change the datafile volume location. In the above example, it is set to /docker_volumes/oradata.

To check the catalog container/services creation logs , please tail docker logs. It will take 20 minutes to create the catalog container service.

```
docker logs catalog
```

#### Deploying Shard Containers
A database shard is a horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine. Each individual partition is referred to as a shard or database shard.

##### Shard1 Container
```
docker run -d --hostname oshard1-0 \
  --dns-search=example.com \
 --network=shard_pub1_nw \
 --ip=172.16.1.21 \
 -e DOMAIN=example.com \
 -e ORACLE_SID=ORCL1CDB \
 -e ORACLE_PDB=ORCL1PDB \
 -e OP_TYPE=primaryshard \
 -e COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE=common_os_pwdfile.enc \
 -e PWD_KEY=pwd.key \
 -v /docker_volumes/oradata:/opt/oracle/oradata \
 -v /tmp/oracle-sharding-si-k8s/scripts:/opt/oracle/scripts/setup \
 -v /opt/containers/shard_host_file:/etc/hosts \
 --volume /opt/.secrets:/run/secrets \
 --privileged=false \
 --name shard1 oracle/database:19.3.0-ee
```

**Note:** Change environment variable such as ORACLE_SID, ORACLE_PDB based on your env. Also, change the datafile volume location. In the above example, it is set to /docker_volumes/oradata.

To check the shard1 container/services creation logs , please tail docker logs. It will take 20 minutes to create the shard1 container service.

```
docker logs shard1
```

##### Shard2 Container
```
docker run -d --hostname oshard2-0 \
  --dns-search=example.com \
 --network=shard_pub1_nw \
 --ip=172.16.1.22 \
 -e DOMAIN=example.com \
 -e ORACLE_SID=ORCL2CDB \
 -e ORACLE_PDB=ORCL2PDB \
 -e OP_TYPE=primaryshard \
 -e COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE=common_os_pwdfile.enc \
 -e PWD_KEY=pwd.key \
 -v /docker_volumes/oradata:/opt/oracle/oradata \
 -v /tmp/oracle-sharding-si-k8s/scripts:/opt/oracle/scripts/setup \
 -v /opt/containers/shard_host_file:/etc/hosts \
 --volume /opt/.secrets:/run/secrets \
 --privileged=false \
  --name shard2 oracle/database:19.3.0-ee
```
**Note:** Change environment variable such as ORACLE_SID, ORACLE_PDB based on your env. Also, change the datafile volume location. In the above example, it is set to /docker_volumes/oradata.

**Note**: You can add more shards based on your requirement.

To check the shard2 container/services creation logs , please tail docker logs. It will take 20 minutes to create the shard2 container service
```
docker logs shard2
```

#### Deploying GSM Container
The Global Data Services framework consists of at least one global service manager, a Global Data Services catalog, and the GDS configuration databases.

```
docker run -d --hostname oshard-gsm1 \
 --dns-search=example.com \
 --network=shard_pub1_nw \
 --ip=172.16.1.15 \
 -e DOMAIN=example.com \
 -e CATALOG_PARAMS="oshard-catalog-0:CATCDB:CAT1PDB" \
 -e PRIMARY_SHARD_PARAMS="oshard1-0:ORCL1CDB:ORCL1PDB;oshard2-0:ORCL2CDB:ORCL2PDB"  \
 -e COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE=common_os_pwdfile.enc \
 -e PWD_KEY=pwd.key \
 -e REGION=region1 \
 --volume /docker_volumes/oradata:/opt/oracle/gsmdata \
 --volume /opt/containers/shard_host_file:/etc/hosts \
 -v /tmp/oracle-sharding-si-k8s/scripts:/opt/oracle/scripts/setup \
 --volume /opt/.secrets:/run/secrets \
 -e OP_TYPE=gsm \
 --privileged=false \
 --name gsm1 oracle/databse-gsm:19.3.0
```

**Note:** Change environment variable such as DOMAIN, CATALOG_PARAMS, PRIMARY_SHARD_PARAMS, COMMON_OS_PWD_FILE and PWD_KEY according to your environment. 

To check the gsm1 container/services creation logs , please tail docker logs. It will take 2 minutes to create the gsm container service.

```
docker logs gsm1
```

You should see following when cman container setup is done:
